Status: Under Development-The code is not yet fully implemented, but the agent design is outlined below.



This prototype aims to showcase how Google ADK and Gemini reasoning can orchestrate multiple agents in a real-time scenario, such as a hit-and-run vehicle incident.
The planned agents include:

-Impact Detection Agent – Detects collisions in real time.

-Vehicle Tracking Agent – Monitors offender vehicle location and status.

-Emergency Dispatch Agent – Summarizes data and sends alerts (Gemini-powered).

-Forensic Agent – Collects and stores evidence and logs.

-Victim Care Agent – Provides first-aid guidance and notifications.
