Status: Under Development
The code is not yet fully implemented, but the directory structure and agent design are outlined below.

This prototype aims to showcase how Google ADK and Gemini reasoning can orchestrate multiple agents in a real-time scenario, such as a hit-and-run vehicle incident.
The planned agents include:
Impact Detection Agent – Detects collisions in real time.
Vehicle Tracking Agent – Monitors offender vehicle location and status.
Emergency Dispatch Agent – Summarizes data and sends alerts (Gemini-powered).
Forensic Agent – Collects and stores evidence and logs.
Victim Care Agent – Provides first-aid guidance and notifications.
